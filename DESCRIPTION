Description: The proposed Gaussian Copula technique generates (unavailable) IPD from simple IPD summaries (like empirical marginal moments and correlation matrix). Ultimate focus is recovery of IPD inferences from the generated data.  Applications are envisioned in fields like Statistical Disclosure Control, Distributed Computing (within infrastructures like DataShield -- see https://cran.datashield.org/), and, provided the required IPD summaries can be retrieved, Research Synthesis (ideally like meta-analysis) and Reproduction.
